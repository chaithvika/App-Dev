            Last year, around this time on a very normal day, I woke up again with the same question juggling in my mind, whether to go to US for further studies or not.
            That day I saw this add on the eenadu news paper about this MSIT course. I was intruiged with the course structure and immediately gave an entrance exam. Eventually I got in.
            There came my another worry. I have started searching about this code online and there were some bad reviews. It was worried whether to join or not.
            Some how I got the contact of an alumni of this program after which I made up my mind to join. Because at that point I knew what I was going into. That's how this journey started.          </p>
