        <p>
            Hello Guys! I am Krishna Chaithvika lagadapati. I was born in Hyderabad I was bought up in Vijayawada.
            I am currently pursuing <span class = "name">Masters in Information technology from IIIT Hyderabad</span>.top</span>
            I have done my graduation from Dhirubhai Ambani institute of information and communication technology which is located at Gujarat in Gandhinagar. 
            
        </p>

            During my B.Tech I was a very curious person. 
            I wanted to play different hats, so for sometime I was into college activites and sports, later I was into IOT, builiding stuff. 
            After that I was into finance for which I had to do a lot of hardwork and finally I halted at algorithm solving and buliding analytical skills.
            Doing all these and having all these options to explore made me think what I want be in future for which I took a period of 6 months after my B.Tech to figure out.
            During Which I gave a GRE exam in which a got a good score but I choose to be in India because of some personal reasons and then joined MSIT at IIIT_HYD.

            My hobbies are doodling, listening to music, watching different kinds of series and movies of various languages so that I get know cultures of different people and their way of thinking. 
            The more I got to see them, the more I understood that, to the core everyone is the same that  and our culture, surroundings and situations etc we face makes us different from one another. 
            Persistance and passion towards work are my positive traits. Whereas, Overthinking is a grey trait of mine.

            My goal is to do something to the society using my skills and knowledge and trying to make things a bit easier for everyone from where I recieve a lot of help from. Personally that would give me satisfaction.
            On the other hand I am a competitive person, if I am able to find a passion, I compete with myself.  My goal is also to better myself in every aspect of my life, per say physically, emotionally or knowledge wise. I thrive daily to become a better version of myself so that I do more good than bad.
